Version 0.2.0 (?? April 2021)
=============================

    * Terminology has changed substantially. The use of `dimension` in version 0.1.0 has been reconsidered and in many cases we now write `signature` instead. This allows us to use the term "dimension" in its usual sense. 
    
    The class :class:`Dimension` has been renamed :class:`Signature`. The structure of a :class:`Signature` is described in terms of a ratio of tuples containing numerical elements (rather than dimensions and exponents).   
    
    

Version 0.1.0 (24 Feb 2020)

    * First release.
