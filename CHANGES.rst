Release Notes

Version 0.2.0 (?? April 2021)
=============================

    * Terminology has changed substantially. Use of the term 'dimension' in version 0.1.0 has been reconsidered and in many cases we now write 'signature' instead. This allows us to use the term 'dimension' correctly. 
    
    * The 'Dimension' class has been renamed 'Signature'. The structure of a Signature class is now described in terms of a ratio of tuples containing numerical elements (rather than a ratio of dimensions composed of exponents). 

    * The 'Unit' class has been renamed 'RegisteredUnit' and placed in its own module, :mod:`registered_unit`.


Version 0.1.0 (24 Feb 2020)
===========================

    * First release.
