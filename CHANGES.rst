Version 0.2.0 (?? April 2021)
=============================

    * Terminology has changed substantially. The use of the term 'dimension' in version 0.1.0 has been reconsidered and in many cases we now write 'signature' instead. This allows us to use 'dimension' in its usual sense. 
    
        The 'Dimension' class  has been renamed 'Signature'. The structure of a Signature class is described in terms of a ratio of tuples containing numerical elements (rather than a ratio of dimensions composed of exponents).   
    
    

Version 0.1.0 (24 Feb 2020)

    * First release.
